A toy Game of Life implementation

I call this a toy implementation because it's using a naive quadtree algorithm rather than the state-of-the-art Hashlife.

However, building it taught me a bit about Typed Racket, and it was a blast to put together.

These can be compiled and run with the [Racket programming language](https://racket-lang.org/).
